**Dr. James Utley PhD,** Chief Scientific Officer at Auragens

At Auragens, our scientific team implements our proprietary process of
immunophenotyping cells during expansion.

Prior to cells being administered to our patients, we evaluate: cell
morphology, optimized cell surface marker selection, cell survivability and
potency, and cell multiplication potential.

The result of this process is a safe, customized and high-performance cellular
product.

> ## We provide our patients an advanced alternative treatment option for
> accelerated healing and rapid recovery.

##### _– Dr. James Utley PhD, Chief Scientific Officer_

Auragens is a leader in the stem cell field because we put our science and
medical first. Creating the best cellular product in-house and using the best
methods for its administration leads to the best results for our patients.

Dr. Utley, here, provides a brief overview of the cells we use and the reason
for it. Auragens believes in transparency and sharing knowledge to benefit the
field as a whole. The more we are able to breakthrough the misinformation the
more effective we will be at making this treatment a standard of care for all
who need it.

![](https://auragens.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cell-Quality-1024x576.png)

**CELL QUALITY**

Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) are a type of stem cell that can
be isolated from the umbilical cord tissue. The quality of hUC-MSCs can be
assessed using a variety of criteria. At Auragens we follow ISCT guidelines
and only use the highest quality hUC-MSCs, that we thoroughly evaluate to make
sure it is pure, viable, multipotent, immunomodulatory, and capable of
expansion.

![](https://auragens.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cell-Volume-1024x576.png)

**CELL VOLUME**

The use of stem cells, including umbilical stem cells, is a complex medical
procedure that requires specialized knowledge and training. The recommended
dose and treatment protocol for umbilical stem cells can vary depending on
factors such as the patient’s age, medical condition, and the specific goals
of the treatment. At Auragens we achieve optimum volume products through
understanding the complexity of the cellular expansion potential. Cellular
expansion potential is important in that hUC-MSCs should be able to expand in
culture while maintaining their stem cell properties. This factor makes
Auragens exceptional in that this technique improves the ability to identify
specific dosing criteria for the individual patient and the specific ailment.

Show MoreShow Less

![](https://auragens.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cell-Type-1024x576.png)

**CELL TYPE**

Auragens uses personalized medicine as we target specific populations of hUC-
MSCs and ensure that they are as pure as possible, meaning they are free from
contamination by other cell types. We use state of the art techniques such as
2D and 3D culturing, and flow cytometry to assess the purity of the cells we
use for administration. Our Type selection process ensures that the hUC-MSCs
are able to survive and thrive after being isolated from the umbilical cord
tissue. A high percentage of viable cells is one of our key selection
indicators of an effective product. In our Type selection process, we also
ensure both Multipotency capability and Immunomodulatory properties are
intact. The secret behind Auragens success is how we custom select the Stem
Cells based on the Immunomodulatory properties. We know that hUC-MSCs should
have the ability to modulate the immune system, so we use those properties and
reinforce them with the latest technologies which can make them useful for
treating certain diseases. We harness the natural capability of the cell to
regenerate and renew to maximize its impact in the body.

**CELL SAFETY**

At Auragens we keep safety at the forefront throughout the continuum of care.
We pride ourselves in evaluating the safety and efficacy of all our cellular
products for intended use. We follow strict manufacturing guidelines outlined
in Title 21 of the US Code of Federal regulations. This includes testing for
infectious diseases, genetic abnormalities, and other potential risks. The
sources of our stem cells are all ethically obtained from non-paid donors, and
we use custom protocols that go “above and beyond” to assess the health of the
donor in addition to screening for potential health risks that could translate
during treatment.

What makes Auragens different than other international “stem cell clinics?”

Auragens is a destination treatment and wellness center that goes far beyond
the scope of traditional stem cell clinics. We take a holistic approach to
healing and incorporate the “triangle of homeostasis” method where the mental,
physical, and nutritional aspects of the treatment are curated to balance the
self. Our medicine is the best in the world and we take tremendous pride in
our treatment enhancement offerings and hosted experiences in Panama. One of
our Patient Experience Executives would be happy to provide more information
on the full compliment of services we provide.

Is this treatment approved by the FDA?

Auragens is not governed by the FDA since we are located outside of the United
States. Regardless, we operate under Title 21 of the United States Code of
Federal Regulations regarding CGMP (Continued Good Manufacturing Practices)
and GTP (Good Tissue Practice).

How much does it cost?

Our treatments start at $14,500 for children 12 and under and $28,500 for
adults and range upwards based on the treatment protocols designed by our
Medical Staff.

Are there any ethical issues involved with the treatments?

There are no ethical issues involved with our treatments whatsoever.

How long will I be at Auragens for treatment?

Our typical treatment protocol is 5 days from Mon-Fri. However, each patient’s
protocol and duration will be determined by our medical staff.

Can I bring a friend or family member?

Absolutely! We offer travel partners a Companion Experience at Auragens.
Please ask your Patient Experience Executive for more information.

At 18,000 square feet, is Auragens the largest stem cell treatment and
research center in the world?

Yes, we are proud to say that we have the largest independent stem cell
treatment and research center in the world.

Is Panama safe?

Panama is one of the safest countries in Latin America based on crime
statistics, travel advisories and tourist guides. The Auragens staff will
ensure that your experience outside the facility is hosted with your safety
and security as the top priority.

What biological medicine does Auragens offer?

  * Umbilical Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hUC-MSCs)
  * Specialized Manufactured Exosome
  * Enhanced High Yield Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)

How are the treatments administered?

Treatment protocols are patient-specific and will be administered via
intravenous (IV) drip, ultrasound guided intramuscular, intrathecal and intra-
articular injections.

Why is Auragens in Panama when there are stem cell clinics in the US?

Auragens treatment capabilities are vastly different than what can be done in
the US. We administer umbilical cord stem cells (hUC-MSCs) which are brand-
new, pristine cells that have not been exposed to genetic defect,
environmental toxins or aging. They are at full capacity in terms of their
ability to regenerate. We maintain a sterile environment and ISO laboratory
throughout the life cycle of the procedure and do not perform same day
procedures so the risk of a bacterial infection is minimized. We customize the
cells with optimized surface markers that provide specific individualized
therapeutic benefit to the condition of the patient. We can expand a targeted
single cell lineage into millions of identical cell types. We concentrate
dosing, guarantee viability and provide data sheets that show the exact cell
count, type and quality. We use Flow Cytometry and 2D & 3D culture techniques
to identify the highest quality cells and contain them in the same environment
for optimal growth. We also can treat for a variety of conditions such as
autoimmune disease, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, neurological
disorder and autism which are not currently approved in the US.

When will I see the results of the treatments?

Timing of results varies by patient and it is important to speak with your
Auragens doctors regarding possible outcomes. Some patients will report
significant results during their time at Auragens and others may not see
results for several weeks following treatment. It is impossible to guarantee
the exact timing of results or if they will occur at all, as age, diet and
lifestyle play a major role in treatment efficacy.

Are the procedures safe?

Yes. The type of treatments we offer do not illicit an immune response from
the body, therefore has an extremely low risk of any type of complications.
Our cells are health tested to the highest level of scientific scrutiny by our
medical staff before they are administered.

Where do the stem cells come from?

Auragens is partnered with local hospitals in Panama and our stem cells are
donated by healthy mothers giving birth via caesarian section. Both the mother
and the cord itself undergo a series of tests by our medical staff to ensure
safety and quality.

Are pharmaceutical drugs involved in the treatments?

No, our treatments are completely non-pharmaceutical.

What type of pre-arrival information do I need to send in?

We will need patients to fill out medical history forms, HIPAA waivers and
send in requested images and/or blood testing required to evaluate a patient’s
candidacy for treatment.

Are there any side effects following treatment?

No long-term effects have been reported. Short-term effects may include a
feeling of fever or chills but that is rare and experienced only briefly.

How far is Auragens from the airport and hotel?

Auragens and the JW Marriott are 25 minutes away from the airport.

Are Auragens treatments covered by insurance?

Treatments at Auragens are not covered by insurance and payment is due prior
to service.
